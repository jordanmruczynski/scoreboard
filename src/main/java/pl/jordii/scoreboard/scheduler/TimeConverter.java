 * This util class is used to convert time units and
 * the central minecraft time unit {@code ticks}.
 *
 * A {@code tick} is one heartbeat of the minecraft server
 * and client and the smallest unit which can be taken to
 * schedule events. One tick is equal to 50ms, so 20 ticks
 * are usually one second. But due to server lags, the server
 * might run at lower tick rates such as 19 or 18 TPS (ticks
 * per second), which is why there is no exact calculation
 * between ticks and seconds.
 *
 * Using scheduler delays or intervals of less than 50ms does
 * not make sense in most cases, because the minecraft server
 * cannot handle this scheduler speed.
